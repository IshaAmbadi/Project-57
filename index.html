        <p class="para">I like painting because its fun. I paint with watercolors, poster paints and acrylic paints. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to paint and express my feelings. I am 14 years old and read in class 9. This hobby can be developed by anyone and everyone can paint beautifully. Don't think about the final result, the process matters the most. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge and inspiration.
